During the review stage of the writing process, I consult with subject matter experts to ensure content accuracy and clarity. I skillfully manage the entire process and deliver documentation in conjunction with the go-live dates for applications. In addition, I develop and maintain documentation templates, style guides, and best practices for the team.

                        <h3>Siebel Query Functionality Script</h3>
                        <p>
		        <b>Overview</b>: This is an example of a detailed Captivate script I wrote for Siebel query functionality. Our team scripted the content in advance of recording to ensure agreement and minimize post-production edits.

                        <p>
                <b>Tools</b>: I created this in Excel, and did the recording in Captivate. Note that the script presented here is in PDF.</p>
	                <p>
                <b>Review Process</b>: Prior to recording, this script was reviewed for accuracy by business and technical analysts, alongside a team review for style accuracy.
